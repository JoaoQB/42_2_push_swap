## Output
The program outputs a series of moves to the standard output, each followed by a newline (`\n`).

The printed set of moves should translate to the sorting of the list, as efficiently as possible with a limited amount of actions.

This push_swap's version complies with:

`set of 3` :

          max 2

`set of 5` : (average 7)

          max 10

`set of 100` (average 587)

          max 665

          less than 700		-> 5
          less than 900		-> 4
          less than 1100	-> 3
          less than 1300	-> 2
          less than 1500	-> 1

`set of 500` (average 5205)

          max 5436

          less than 5500	-> 5
          less than 7000	-> 4
          less than 8500	-> 3
          less than 10000	-> 2
          less than 11500	-> 1
